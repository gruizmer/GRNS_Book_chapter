The dataset files contain the steady-state and dynamic (time sets) chemical process simulation results (mass flows, temperature profiles), GREENSCOPE performance indicator results, and concentration profiles of different components for the production of acetic acid (with two separation schemes), a novel biorefinery process when operated at steady state, and the dynamic assessment for optimization and control of a coal/biomass co-gasification process (with and without a novel process control strategy). The datasets show all data values used to generate each of the figures.
