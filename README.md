# GRNS_Book_chapter

This repository contains all the data needed to run the case studies for the CRC book chapter entitled "Current Progress in Sustainability Evaluation, Pollution Prevention, and Source Reduction using GREENSCOPE."

The dataset files contain the steady-state and dynamic (time sets) chemical process simulation results (mass flows, temperature profiles), GREENSCOPE performance indicator results, and concentration profiles of different components for the production of acetic acid (with two separation schemes), a novel biorefinery process when operated at steady state, and the dynamic assessment for optimization and control of a coal/biomass co-gasification process (with and without a novel process control strategy). The datasets show all data values used to generate each of the figures. 

Dr. Fernando V. Lima's research group from the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at West Virginia University (Morgantown, WV USA), provided all datasets from the chemical process simulation, case study, indicators, releases, process control output values, and time value results.
